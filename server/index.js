If a client does NOT have outstanIf a client starts out with 2 seasons of outstanding credit (debt):

CustomerSummary (Client owes 20)
Season = 2011
TotalRepaid = 80
TotalCredit = 100

CustomerSummary (Client owes 90)
Season = 2012
TotalRepaid = 30
TotalCredit = 120

When the client makes a payment of 60, we would expect to save 3 repayment records:

Repaymend record #1 - Season = 2011, Amount = +60 - original repayment record
Repayment record #2 - Season = 2011, Amount = -40 - adjustment repayment record
Repayment record #3 - Season = 2012, Amount = +40 - adjustment repayment record

And we would also expect to see updated customer summaries:

CustomerSummary (Client owes 0)
Season = 2011
TotalRepaid = 100
TotalCredit = 100

CustomerSummary (Client owes 50)
Season = 2012
TotalRepaid = 70
TotalCredit = 120
ding credit in a later season, or does NOT have outstanding credit in ANY season, then NO adjustment repayments are made, and the full amount is applied to the clientâ€™s most recent season.
